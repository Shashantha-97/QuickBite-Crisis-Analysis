# QuickBite Express: Crisis Recovery & Strategic Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a part of **Codebasic Resume Challenge 18** that provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a critical business crisis faced by QuickBite Express, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup. The goal was to identify the depth of the impact and develop recovery strategies to regain market stability.

## 📖 Project Context
Before June 2025, QuickBite Express was performing strongly in the food-tech sector. The company faced a major crisis due to a viral social media incident involving food safety violations, followed by a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season.

This resulted in a severe decline across all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

**Revenue & Orders:** Sharp decline in daily order volume and total revenue.  
**SLA Compliance %:** Massive drop in delivery timelines and service level agreements.  
**Customer Trust:** Significant rise in churn rates and a fall in satisfaction scores.  
**Partner Stability:** High merchant churn as partner restaurants moved to competitors.  

In response, the leadership team allocated recovery funds to stabilize the platform and required a data-backed strategy to win back the market.

## 🚀 Strategic Insights & Recommendations

Beyond the technical dashboard, I translated the data into a strategic recovery roadmap focused on three core pillars:

### **1. Financial & Growth Impact**
* **Revenue Hemorrhage:** Orders declined **~69%**, driving a **~71%** revenue contraction.
* **Churn Mitigation:** Recommended targeting the **67% churned top-spenders** with a **100% On-Time Guarantee** for their next 5 orders to neutralize "1-10 min delay" sensitivity.
* **Market Expansion:** Proposed a **Budget Category (AOV <₹200)** to capture the untapped **97% market volume** and diversify revenue risk.

### **2. Operational Breakdown**
* **SLA Restoration:** Aiming to restore SLA to **≥85%** (from a crisis low of 12%) by incentivizing riders to stay within **3km high-density hubs** during peak hours.
* **Fleet Stability:** Proposed a **"Surge-Retention"** pay model for riders during disruptions to prevent the **12% fleet churn**.
* **Partner Resilience:** Identified a gap where high-revenue partners held low Resilience Scores, exposing the core business to quality and packaging risks.

### **3. Customer Retention & Sentiment**
* **Service Recovery:** Recommended **Instant Wallet Credits** for any order exceeding EDT by **>20 mins** to preempt negative reviews.
* **Quality Gamification:** Proposed rewarding high-QA/Packaging scores with **Top-of-App Placement** and **"Quality Verified" badges** to drive organic growth through performance rather than payouts.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Addressed recurring keywords like **"Again," "Late," and "Stale"** to break the cycle of repetitive operational failures.
