QuickBite Express: Crisis Recovery & Strategic Analysis

📌 Project Description
This project provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a critical business crisis faced by QuickBite Express, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup. The goal was to identify the depth of the impact and develop recovery strategies to regain market stability.

📖 Project Context
Before June 2025, QuickBite Express was performing strongly in the food-tech sector. The company faced a major crisis due to a viral social media incident involving food safety violations, followed by a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season.

This resulted in a severe decline across all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Revenue & Orders: Sharp decline in daily order volume and total revenue.
SLA Compliance %: Massive drop in delivery timelines and service level agreements.
Customer Trust: Significant rise in churn rates and a fall in satisfaction scores.
Partner Stability: High merchant churn as partner restaurants moved to competitors.

In response, the leadership team allocated recovery funds to stabilize the platform and required a data-backed strategy to win back the market.
