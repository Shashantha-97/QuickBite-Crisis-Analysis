# QuickBite Express: Crisis Recovery & Strategic Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a part of **Codebasic Resume Challenge 18** that provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of a critical business crisis faced by QuickBite Express, a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup. The goal was to identify the depth of the impact and develop recovery strategies to regain market stability.

## 📖 Project Context
Before June 2025, QuickBite Express was performing strongly in the food-tech sector. The company faced a major crisis due to a viral social media incident involving food safety violations, followed by a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season.

This resulted in a severe decline across all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

**Revenue & Orders:** Sharp decline in daily order volume and total revenue.  
**SLA Compliance %:** Massive drop in delivery timelines and service level agreements.  
**Customer Trust:** Significant rise in churn rates and a fall in satisfaction scores.  
**Partner Stability:** High merchant churn as partner restaurants moved to competitors.  

In response, the leadership team allocated recovery funds to stabilize the platform and required a data-backed strategy to win back the market.
